# Random Forest Regressor with Scikit Learn

Random Forest Regressor with Scikit Learn for Heart Disease Prediction 

Warm Up: Machine Learning with a Heart
HOSTED BY DRIVENDATA

I used a Random Forest Regressor from Scikit Learn to predict if a given patient has a heart disease 

I originallt used a Feedforward Neural Network but the Random Forest Regressor had a better log loss as can be seen in the model file.
